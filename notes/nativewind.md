# nativewind

The NativeWind package is a utility library that brings Tailwind CSS functionality to React Native. Here's a list of use cases to test when using the NativeWind package in React Native:

1. Basic Class Usage:
   - Apply basic utility classes such as `text-[color]`, `bg-[color]`, `p-[size]`, `m-[size]`, etc.
   - Verify that the styles are applied correctly and match the expected Tailwind CSS behavior.

2. Class Composition:
   - Combine multiple utility classes to create composite styles using the `classNames` or `tw` utility functions provided by NativeWind.
   - Ensure that the composed classes generate the desired styles and that they can be used interchangeably with regular utility classes.

3. Responsive Design:
   - Test the responsiveness of styles by using responsive utility classes such as `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, etc.
   - Verify that the styles change appropriately based on the screen size or device orientation.

4. Custom Configuration:
   - Customize the configuration of the NativeWind package by modifying the `tailwind.config.js` file.
   - Test that the modifications to the configuration file result in the expected changes to the available utility classes.

5. Component Styling:
   - Apply utility classes to different React Native components such as `Text`, `View`, `Image`, `Button`, etc.
   - Check that the styles are correctly applied to each component and that they align with the Tailwind CSS utility class definitions.

6. Styling Lists:
   - Test styling utility classes for lists and list items, such as `list-disc`, `list-decimal`, `list-none`, etc.
   - Ensure that the styles are correctly applied to the respective list components.

7. Typography:
   - Test typography utility classes such as `text-[size]`, `font-[weight]`, `uppercase`, `lowercase`, `break-words`, etc.
   - Check that the text styles are correctly applied and that the typographic variations are consistent with the Tailwind CSS definitions.

8. Interaction States:
    - Apply utility classes for handling interaction states, such as `hover:`, `focus:`, `active:`, etc.
    - Test that the interaction styles change accordingly when interacting with the components.
