# Apollo client

Here are some Apollo Client implementations you can start with, ranging from basic to advanced, to explore the advantages and limitations of the package:

1. Basic Implementation:
   - Set up Apollo Client in a simple React Native application.
   - Create a basic query to fetch data from a GraphQL API.
   - Display the fetched data in your React Native components.
   - Test the basic data fetching and caching capabilities of Apollo Client.

2. Pagination and Infinite Scrolling:
   - Implement pagination in your React Native app using Apollo Client.
   - Set up a GraphQL API that supports pagination.
   - Fetch data in chunks using pagination and display it in a scrollable list.
   - Test the performance and efficiency of Apollo Client when working with large datasets.

3. Optimistic UI and Offline Support:
   - Implement optimistic UI updates using Apollo Client.
   - Create mutations that update data on the server and locally.
   - Test the optimistic UI rendering and syncing capabilities of Apollo Client.
   - Simulate offline scenarios and observe how Apollo Client handles offline data management.

4. Real-time Updates with Subscriptions:
   - Set up a GraphQL subscription server and implement real-time updates in your React Native app using Apollo Client.
   - Create subscriptions to receive real-time data updates.
   - Test the subscription functionality and observe how Apollo Client handles real-time data syncing and reactivity.

5. Advanced Caching and Data Management:
   - Explore advanced caching strategies in Apollo Client, such as custom cache resolvers, cache manipulation, and cache updates.
   - Implement fine-grained control over cache behavior using Apollo Client's cache APIs.
   - Test the performance and flexibility of Apollo Client's caching mechanisms in complex data scenarios.

6. Advanced Error Handling and Retry Strategies:
   - Simulate error scenarios in your GraphQL API and test Apollo Client's error handling capabilities.
   - Implement custom error handling and retry strategies using Apollo Client's error link and retry link.
   - Test the resilience and fault tolerance of your React Native app when dealing with network errors.

By implementing these scenarios, you can gradually explore and understand the advantages and limitations of Apollo Client. This will help you leverage its features effectively and make informed decisions while building GraphQL-powered React Native applications.
